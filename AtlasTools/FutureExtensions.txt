1. Try to get some brainstem atlas if possible.
   a) ask if MRIstudio contains an atlas from Aggarwal???
   b) try to incorporate this atlas if it is suitable.

2. Portable Version of AtlasTools
   a) make whole brain mask & smooth a little, then threshold >0.2 (mm accuracy)
   b) investigate each atlas and write out results in a Cell Array (nVoxelx2)
      1st column contains coordinates with mm accuracy & 2nd column has atlas entry
   c) save each as "AtlasName_Brain1mmISO_Inquiry.mat"
   d) make portable version of codes that use the saved *.mat files for lookup.
      Use a check for FSL Version for asking user if she wants to use the portable version or possibly newer FSL Version
   e) check if this lookup is faster, if yes, make it the default version.
