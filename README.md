# AtlasROI_Tools
Algorithms for using "atlasquery" from MATLAB. 
"atlasquery" is a tool that comes with FSL. 
These tools can extract coordinates from a statistical parameteric mapping SPM results table
or a NIFTI statistics file via clustering the peak activations,
and then call "atlasquery" to find the brain regions for each coordinate.

WARNING: THIS TOOL NEEDS A RUNNING VERSION OF FSL INSTALLED!!!
