# AtlasROI_Tools
Algorithms for using "atlasquery" a tool that comes with FSL from MATLAB. These tools can extract coordinates from a statistical parameteric mapping SPM results table or a NIFTI statistics file via clustering the peak activations and then calling "atlasquery" to find the brain regions for each coordinate.
