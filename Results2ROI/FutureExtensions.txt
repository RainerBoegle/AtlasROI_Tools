1.) Add a maximal distance that a voxel can migrate from it's original position.
    Currently it is possible that if TWO (or more) local maxima are just at the minimum distance apart from each other,
    that this will result in all voxels migrating to the highest local maxima of the two, instead of both being preserved.
    
    NB: this is not really a problem, just a very special case and maybe doesn't need to specified,
        but just fixed by making the iteration algorithm sensitive to the number of iterations, 
        replacing the <= with < in the distance checks.
